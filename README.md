## ArbSoftware
###Final Year Project

---

###Description
My project is an arbitrage betting website. For information on what arbitrage betting is look here 
[sports betting worm](http://www.sportsbettingworm.com/arbitrage-betting/). My project is made up of two applications
the [ArbitrageScraper](/ArbitrageScraper) and the [ArbitrageWebsite](/ArbitrageWebsite). The scraper app scrapes different bookmakers
websites and performs calculations on the data it scrapes and the website provides people with a chance to use the data and place arbitrage bets.

In this Readme I will have a list of what this repository contains along with instructions on running the project.

###What is contains
